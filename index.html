                <p>Welcome to my Homepage. This is my first time creating my own website using text editors. </p>
                <p>Project doumentation is very important. If it isn't documented, it didn't happen. Regarding the fact that documentation is important, it helps to record of the past to whatever I have experience as an engineer. </p>
                <p>I join the engineering academy to enhance my skills and to improve on my knowledge. To learn new skillsets to be able to apply it during my work & further studies.</p>
